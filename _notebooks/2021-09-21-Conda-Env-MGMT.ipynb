    "[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo) offers a service like [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) that serves user-created packaged code, but unlike PyPI or CRAN, there are many other such repos for `conda` packages, and these are referred to as **channels**. Some major `conda channels` are:\n",
    "* [**Conda-Forge**](https://conda-forge.org/) (most popular public channel)\n",
    "* [**Bioconda**](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html) (mainly used for biostatistical packages)\n",
    "* [**R**](https://anaconda.org/r/repo) (unsurprisingly, for **R** packages)\n",

    "Or you could build your own [private conda channel](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/create-custom-channels.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature of this channel system is that it increases the likelihood that someone has built the most recent version of the package you want, but a drawback is that can slow down the dependency resolver as it has more places it can check for the requested package. The `conda` configuration recommended by **Conda-forge** is to set `channel_priority` to **strict** and add the **conda-forge** channel. These settings will be stored in the `.condarc` file in your home directory, which you can view either by"
